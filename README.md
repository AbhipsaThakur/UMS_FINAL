# UMS_FINAL
 This University Management System project is a web application designed to streamline and automate various aspects of university management, including student and staff registrations, faculty management, and feedback collection. Built using Java Servlets and JSP, the project uses MySQL as the database for data storage and retrieval, making it highly reliable and scalable.

The project leverages several essential libraries for smooth functionality:

mysql-connector.jar: Facilitates connection and interaction with the MySQL database.
jbCrypt.jar: Used to enhance security through encrypted password handling.
servlet-api.jar: Provides essential classes and interfaces for creating and managing servlets.
javax.activation.jar and javax.mail.jar: Support email functionalities within the application, including email notifications for users.
The project runs on Apache Tomcat 10.1, which serves as the runtime environment, enabling effective deployment and management of servlet-based web applications.

This University Management System provides a user-friendly interface for administrators, students, and faculty, with a focus on secure authentication, efficient data management, and clear, responsive design.
